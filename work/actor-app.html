        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Improving Casting Workbook’s digital sign up process to increase the number of new sign ups that complete onboarding and reduce the strain on the customer service team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Casting Workbook helps actors to find jobs. Online sign up rates were low but the customer service team were swamped with calls from people trying to sign up.</p>
        <p>We were getting traffic to the sign up forms but only 13% were completing it, with a huge drop off right at the start.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Problems</h4>
        <p class="above-list">I spoke to the customer service team and some of the actors trying to sign up. The same problems kept coming up:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We were asking for too much information</p></li>
            <li><p>Actors were confused about which account type they needed</p></li>
            <li><p>They didn’t trust our payment processor</p></li>    
            <li><p>The majority of our traffic was mobile but the form was almost unusable on a phone</p></li>        
        </ul>
        <p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible for actors to get started but Casting Workbook’s code and business logic had become entangled over the years so even figuring out what we could realistically do was a task.</p>
        <p>Through a series of workshops, we cut the number of required fields from 30 down to 8 and decided that going forward all new plans would be the same with just 2 options - to pay monthly or yearly.</p>
        <p>We built a quick version of the new form into the site so we could test it against the original sign up form.</p>
        <p>The results were conclusive. The new sign up flow increased the conversion rate from 13% to 64%. Splitting out every field to it’s own screen helped us to see specifically which were causing problems so that we could iterate and improve quickly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Increased conversion rate from 13% to 64%</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduced sign up fields from 30 to 8</p></li>
            <li><p>Customer sign up calls down 55%</p></li>
            <li><p>Added sign up into native apps </p></li>
        </ul>
