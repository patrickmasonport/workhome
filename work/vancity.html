        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>I worked with Vancity to build a new website for current and prospective members.</p>
        <p>By reducing friction, we increased conversion rates over 500%.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Vancity had a great in-person experience but that didn’t translate to their online presence. Their site was difficult to use and not optimised for search or mobile traffic.</p>
        <p>Members found the site confusing and didn’t know which financial products we offered.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>We looked at which pages on the old site were most commonly used and where the drop-offs where to map the typical user flows.</p>
        <p>For each financial product, we worked with customer-facing staff and members to understand the common questions people had and how typical conversations would play out.</p>
        <p>This helped to focus our user journeys and plan content outlines.</p>
        <p>It was difficult to get legal approval to put a work-in-progress website live in the financial industry. And without real traffic we wouldn’t know what would work.</p>
        <p>We used usability testing software extensively but it was tough to say whether or not our changes would lead explicitly to more sign ups.</p>
        <p>So, I led a collaboration with marketing to launch stand alone campaign product pages using our new designs. Each page was vetted by legal individually and a/b tested against a page in the original style.</p>
        <p>The new webpages tested well. The conversion rate on a typical product page increased by over 500%.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>As well as conversion increases, 69% of members, and 85% of staff, agreed that the new website represented Vancity better than the old one.</p>
        <p>Security, performance, mobile and SEO measurements all increased.</p>
        <p>The new architecture also meant we could spin up quickly. Like the Vancity Community Centre, that was created to support our members at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was designed, built and launched in under a week.</p>
        <p>As part of this project, we also created a new design system unique to the website but familiar to Vancity’s overall design language that the wider design team had been developing.</p>
        <p>A phased transition to the new site architecture was planned for 2021-22.</p>
