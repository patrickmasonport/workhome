        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Mogo are committed to helping Canadian’s achieve financial freedom. The #1 way to reach financial freedom is by investing to build wealth.</p>
        <p>DIY investing was growing in Canada but Canadian’s didn’t have many options for investing platforms. They were stuck with slow platforms, high commissions and poor user experiences.</p>
        <p>Until MogoTrade.</p>
        <p>In April 2021, without a team in place, Mogo publicly committed to launching a commission-free investment app by the start of 2022. Giving us 9 months to design and build MogoTrade.</p>

        <h4>Problems</h4>
        <p class="above-list">Speaking to Canadian investors, we identified their main problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Cost</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Commissions + FX fees eat into their wealth building, and it's hard to work out what they're being charged</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p>Complexity</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Traditional platforms over-complicated simple tasks</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p>Convenience</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Most of the current platforms weren’t mobile-native</p></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>We held workshops to map out and prioritise our MVP. Leaders were involved from product, engineering, compliance and business to understand all perspectives and get alignment quickly and transparently.</p>
        <p>We launched a waitlist website to test our value props and build excitement while we built out the MVP.</p>
        <p>I prototyped and tested every major flow with target users to get quick, actionable feedback to simplify and improve the experience.</p>
        <p>Mogo had an existing design system but it didn’t fit the requirements of a best-in-class investing experience. Along with our director of design, I led the creation of a new design system for MogoTrade from scratch.</p>

    <div class="contained subhead-text">
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p class="above-list">We onboarded our first users over Christmas 2021 and the early signs were promising. Users were signing up, depositing and starting to make their first investments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>#1 Finance App in Canada (Jan 2022)</p></li>
            <li><p>Millions of dollars invested in first few months</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After launch, we continued to improve based on user feedback and insights.</p>
